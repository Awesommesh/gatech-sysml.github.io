title: "HOLMES: Health OnLine Model Ensemble Serving for Deep Learning Models in Intensive Care Units"
subtitle: "At Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2020"
summary: "In many clinical environments such as intensive care unit (ICU), real-time model serving is equally if not more important than accuracy. To make timely decisions, we argue the underlying serving system must be latency-aware. HOLMES is an online model ensemble serving framework for healthcare applications. HOLMES dynamically identifies the best performing set of models to ensemble for highest accuracy, while also satisfying sub-second latency constraints on end-to-end prediction."
