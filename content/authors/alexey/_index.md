Alexey Tumanov is a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Georgia TEch since August 2019. His research interests include Systems for Machine Learning, specifically soft real-time ML support, resource management for distributed ML, distributed inference, distributed dataframe analytics, and latency-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Prof. Tumanov completed his postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley with Ion Stoica and in close collaboration with several other co-directors of RISELab, including Joseph Gonzalez and Joe Hellerstein. During his PhD studies at Carnegie Mellon, Alexey focused on the development of the first declarative, heterogeneity-aware scheduling framework capable of capturing a large class of combinatorial constraints and preferences on resource space-time.
